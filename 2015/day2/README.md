# Day 2

Also not crazy, but had to follow along with the math examples a little closer.

Took learnings from first puzzle to read from file, had to learn how to parse strings into integers, and have a feeling I might have done it super verbosely.

Second new concept was sorting a vector and retrieving items from it.

Similar to previous day, math itself wasn't insane (just had to read closely)

## Thoughts for Improvement

* Can probably convert [this line](https://github.com/gvanderest/advent2015/blob/main/day2/src/main.rs#L35) to also do a mapping parse to integers, then `part_to_int` could be removed?
* Learn if I am converting from string reference to string to parsed integer properly [in these lines](https://github.com/gvanderest/advent2015/blob/main/day2/src/main.rs#L4-L6)
