# 2022 Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors

## Part 1

Each line is going to be an input move and an output move, and then based on outcome we get a score.

I'm thinking I'll do something like ...

- Convert/normalize each line into opponent and my move
- Compare the two moves to determine winner
- Calculate math based on outcome and move

And hope it works?

## Part 2

Intending to make a little tweak to how I computed the part 1 solve to now determine move to use based on expected outcome mapping.

Should be a little elbow grease, but easy?

## Thoughts

Okay, so .. what blew me away with this question, and it might have been a bit of a fluke, is that I wrote out my pseudo-code in comments, then basically implemented exactly what I said I would, and both parts worked on first execution.

I feel like a little bit of this was because of how I thought about solving it, and sure.. I saved the files a lot and leveraged the language server's errors heavily. But I seriously ran this program only twice: Once when I finished part 1, and then once when I finished part 2, and it worked flawlessly.

Pretty cool feeling.
