# 2021 Day 4

## Part 1

That took quite a bit of brainpower, because it was Rust. I feel like if I'd used Python/JS, I'd have reached the answer a lot faster-- but more dirtily.

## Part 2

Fortunately, because of the way I approached the first part, implementing this was not difficult; however, I made a mistake regarding storing the winners in order, which made it difficult to look up the final winner.

## Thoughts

-   I do not yet understand the borrow checker very well, but it does a good job of complaining.
-   Learned a little more about HashSet and HashMap
-   Wrote my first structs for the Board and BoardSlot to track some values
