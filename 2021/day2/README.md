# 2021 Day 2

## Part 1

-   Definitely love that the learning on these grows, I feel like I was able to remember some cool things from yesterday, like reading files.
-   This part felt easier than yesteday's problem.. maybe evidence I approached yesterday's weird.

## Part 2

-   Simple change of what the commands map to.. nice!

## Remaining Thoughts

-   Starting to get a little bit of a grasp on vectors.
-   Slightly fighting the borrow checker less.
-   I'm wondering if I'm honestly being super inefficient with memory management, just because I add keywords to get things to work-- but I'm not fully conscious of how many resources I'm using.
